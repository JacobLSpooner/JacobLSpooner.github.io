    "text": "Real Madrid’s Champions League triumph last season was a memorable one to say the least.

However, the way in which those matches played out has left many skeptical. Did the stars just happen to align in Real Madrid’s road to glory? An observation of overall chances, as well as data related to expected goals, help provide further insight into the baffling nature of Madrid’s ability to get the job done on the biggest stage of them all."
