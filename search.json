    "text": "Real Madrid’s Champions League triumph last season was a memorable one to say the least. Emerging victorious against the likes of PSG, Chelsea, Manchester City, and Liverpool, labeling these champions as a fluke seems rather harsh. However, the way in which those matches played out has left many skeptical. Did the stars just happen to align in Real Madrid’s road to glory? An observation of overall chances, as well as data related to expected goals, help provide further insight into the baffling nature of Madrid’s ability to get the job done on the biggest stage of them all."

    "text": "Currently in the football (soccer) analytics world, expected goals is a hot topic that is becoming more and more familiar to your everyday fan. The expected goal value for each shot depends on a mathematical model taking takes multiple events when the shot is taken (such as shot position and attack type). Thus, the expected goals generated by a team in a given match are calculated by summing up the expected goal value of each shot throughout the match. It is worth noting that since expected goals are a subjective metric, that the data pertaining to them on FBref might differ from data elsewhere.\nNow regarding Real Madrid and expected goals last season, before diving straight into those knockout stage Champions League ties against other European juggernauts, we ought to take a look at how they performed in La Liga. Particularly of interest is the outcome of matches where the expected goals margin between Los Blancos and its opponents was 0.5 or less. Below are the 11 fixtures in which the expected goals margin was this tight. The green represents the actual goal differential between Madrid and its opponent, while the red represents the expected goal differential between them.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nrm_laliga_logs <- read_csv(\"madrid_laliga_logs.csv\")\n\nrm_laliga_logs2 <-  rm_laliga_logs %>% \ngroup_by(Opponent) %>%\n  mutate(xG_Diff = xG - xGA) %>%\n  mutate(GD = GF -GA)\n\nclose_fixtures <- rm_laliga_logs2 %>%\n  filter(abs(xG_Diff) < 0.5)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=close_fixtures, \n    aes(y=Opponent, x=GD, xend=xG_Diff),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=0, color=\"black\") +\nlabs(\n  x=\"Goal Differential\",\n  y=\"Opponent\",\n  title=\"La Liga Champions Outperform Expected Goal Difference in Tight Fixtures\", \n     subtitle=\"Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Levante all fall to league defeats against Real Madrid \ndespite slightly outmatching Los Blancos in this statistic. Only Getafe and Osasuna manage to snatch \npoints off the Kings of Spain in these close affairs.\",\n  caption=\"Source: FBref | by Jacob Spooner\"\n     ) +\n  theme_minimal () +\n  theme (\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 7),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 9 out of the 11 fixtures with tight expected goal margins, Real Madrid managed to outperform its expected goal differential. As a result, this metric suggests that Real Madrid was not as domestically dominant as the final La Liga table indicates.\nWhat about the Champions League? How did Real Madrid’s expected goals stack up against its opponents during its Champions League knockout fixtures?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nrm <- c(\"vs PSG\"=2, \"vs Chelsea\"=2.7, \"vs Manchester City\"=4.2, \"vs Liverpool\"=0.9, 3.4)\nvsrm <- c(\"PSG\"=3.5, \"Chelsea\"=3, \"Manchester City\"=4.3, \"Liverpool\"=2.4)\n\niron(\n waffle(\n   rm*25, \n   rows = 10, \n   xlab=\"Real Madrid's Expected Goals\",\n   colors = c(\"#00529F\", \"#EE324E\", \"#FEBE10\", \"black\", \"white\")) + \n   labs(\n     title=\"Madrid Survive and Advance in Spite of Fewer Expected Goals\", \n     subtitle=\"Chelsea and Manchester City edge Los Blancos in this metric during the UCL Quarter and \nSemi-Finals, while PSG and Liverpool display dominance in the Round of 16 and Final.\") + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ),\n waffle(\n   vsrm*25, \n   rows = 10, \n   xlab=\"Expected Goals vs Real Madrid\\n1 square = 0.04 Expected Goals\", \n   colors = c(\"#ceab5d\", \"#034694\", \"#6CABDD\", \"#c8102E\")) + \n   labs(caption=\"Source: FBref | by Jacob Spooner\")\n) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe waffle chart could not paint it any clearer. Real Madrid got smoked in terms of expected goals on its run to UCL glory. Somewhat ironically, the two ties where they were not absolutely demolished were the ones that required extra time.\nDespite this it is worth keeping in mind that data can be skewed in a few games of a knockout competition. Maybe a league-wide comparison would tell a different story. How do Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool’s expected goals for and against in the Premier League, and PSG’s in Ligue 1, compare to that of Real Madrid in La Liga?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nleagues <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(2022,stat_type=\"standard\",team_or_player=\"team\", time_pause = 3\n)\n\n\nleagues_wide <- leagues %>%\n  select(Squad, Team_or_Opponent, xG_Expected) %>%\n    pivot_wider(names_from = Team_or_Opponent, values_from = xG_Expected)\n\nrm <- leagues_wide %>% filter(Squad == \"Real Madrid\")\nvsrm_ucl <- leagues_wide %>% filter(Squad == \"Paris S-G\" | Squad == \"Chelsea\" | Squad == \"Manchester City\" | Squad == \"Liverpool\")\n\naverages <- leagues_wide %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(Avg_xG = mean(team), Avg_xG_Against = mean(opponent))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=leagues_wide, aes(x=team, y=opponent), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=rm, aes(x=team, y=opponent, label=Squad), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=vsrm_ucl, aes(x=team, y=opponent), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=54.8, color=\"dark grey\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=54.8, color=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=70, y=30, label=\"Quality Attack, Quality Defense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=43, y=63, label=\"Poor Defense, Poor Attack\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=rm, aes(x=team, y=opponent, label=Squad)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=vsrm_ucl, aes(x=team, y=opponent, label=Squad)) +\nlabs(\n  x=\"Expected Goals For\",\n  y=\"Expected Goals Against\",\n  title=\"Los Blancos Lack Domestic Expected Goal Dominance of UCL Opponents\", \n     subtitle=\"Manchester City, Liverpool, PSG and Chelsea all concede fewer high quality goal scoring opporunities \nthan Real Madrid in league play. In fact, with the expection of the Blues, they all create more as well.\",\n  caption=\"Source: FBref | by Jacob Spooner\"\n     ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme (\nplot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 7),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, Real Madrid falls short of these other clubs. While Los Blancos may have taken home the most prestigious prize in world football, arguably the hottest topic in football analytics implies that this team was not Europe’s finest. It could be that the brilliance of Karim Benzema at one end and Thibaut Courtois at the other explains this over performance in relation to expected goals. However, it is difficult to dismiss the role of luck in a few one off Champions League ties in a sport where luck is more prevalent than others."
